# CLEAN_UP_BASH

there's dangerous code in the bash script.....clean it up to something safe i can use for safe clean up, Proper Path Handling, Improved Logging, & Safe File Removal

I dont want any dangerous commands, syntax errors...or unnecessary processes

make sure to test the script in your enviroment before sending me the Pull Request, reason is because ill test it on my enviroment. if it destroys my enviroment....itll be an automatic fail of the whole assessment

ill also scan for dangerous code within the script...if i see it, itll also be an automatic fail of the whole assessment

reason is, you can fuck up a whole company if you're not careful....

SO INVESTIGATE....I DONT WANT TO SEE ONE DANGEROUS CODE LEFT IN THE SCRIPT. CLEAN IT UP
